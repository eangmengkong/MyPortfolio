# Comprehensive Plan for Redesigning Styles in Components Folder

## Information Gathered

- All component files use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Components include common (Header, Heading), home (Hero, Home), and pages (About, Contact, Pages, Project, Resume).
- Current styles are functional but basic, using standard Tailwind utility classes.
- Components use responsive layouts, AOS animations, and some external libraries (Typewriter, react-icons).
- Common styling patterns include flexbox, grid, shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects.
- Some components use background gradients and images.
